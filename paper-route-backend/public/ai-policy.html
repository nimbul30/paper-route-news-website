          AI Policy Statement
        </h1>
        <div class="prose max-w-none text-pr-primary">
          <p>
            At The Paper Route News, we are committed to leveraging technology
            to provide clear, balanced, and efficient news. This policy outlines
            how we use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our products, such as the
            News Synthesizer, to enhance your understanding of the world.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-display">1. AI-Powered Summarization</h2>
          <p>
            Our core AI feature is the topic synthesizer, which aggregates
            articles from diverse sources and generates a single, concise
            summary. The goal is to give you a comprehensive overview of a news
            story quickly. These summaries are generated by Large Language
            Models (LLMs) and are designed to be neutral and factual.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-display">2. Human Oversight</h2>
          <p>
            While AI generates the initial summaries, we believe in the
            irreplaceability of human judgment. All AI-generated content is
            subject to review, editing, and fact-checking by our team of human
            editors before publication. No article is published without human
            oversight.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-display">3. Bias and Perspective</h2>
          <p>
            We recognize that AI models can reflect biases from their training
            data. To counter this, we provide features like the "Perspective
            Spectrum" to show the political leaning of the sources used in a
            synthesis. Our goal is to make media bias transparent, helping you
            understand how different sides are reporting on an issue.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-display">4. Transparency</h2>
          <p>
            We are committed to being transparent about our use of AI. Whenever
            content is significantly aided by AI, it will be clearly disclosed.
            We will always provide links to the original source articles used
            for synthesis.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-display">5. Policy Updates</h2>
          <p>
            The field of AI is constantly evolving. We will regularly review and
            update this policy to reflect our current practices and the latest
            developments in technology.
