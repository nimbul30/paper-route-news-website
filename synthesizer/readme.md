1. Introduction
   News Synthesizer is an intelligent web application designed to combat information overload and media bias. By leveraging AI, it aggregates news from diverse sources on a single topic and presents users with a single, coherent, and balanced summary. This product moves beyond a simple news feed, offering users clarity, perspective, and a deeper understanding of the world without requiring hours of research. Our goal is to make being well-informed both effortless and efficient.

2. Problem Statement
   Modern news consumers face significant challenges:
   Information Overload: The sheer volume of news is unmanageable, leading to fatigue and disengagement.
   Filter Bubbles & Echo Chambers: Algorithmic personalization reinforces existing beliefs, preventing exposure to diverse viewpoints and creating a polarized understanding of events.
   Unidentified Media Bias: It is difficult and time-consuming for users to identify the inherent bias in news sources, making it hard to find objective truth.
   Time Scarcity: Professionals, students, and parents lack the time to read multiple articles from various sources to get a comprehensive view of an issue.

3. Product Goals & Objectives
   User Goals:
   To quickly understand the key facts and perspectives of a major news story.
   To save time while staying comprehensively informed.
   To easily identify and understand media bias on any given topic.
   To track the development of ongoing stories without having to re-read background information.
   Business Goals:
   Launch an MVP within 4-6 months to capture the market for intelligent news aggregation.
   Achieve 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) within the first 6 months post-launch.
   Establish News Synthesizer as a trusted, go-to source for unbiased, synthesized news.
   Achieve a user retention rate of 30% after 30 days.

4. Target Audience & User Personas
   The Busy Professional (Persona: "Alex")
   Demographics: 30-50 years old, works in a demanding field like tech, finance, or medicine.
   Needs: Wants to stay informed for work and social conversations but has only 15-20 minutes a day for news. Values efficiency and factual accuracy.
   Frustrations: Annoyed by clickbait, repetitive articles, and partisan shouting matches.
   The Curious Student (Persona: "Sam")
   Demographics: 18-25 years old, in university or higher education.
   Needs: Needs to understand multiple viewpoints for research papers, debates, and personal development. Seeks to understand the "why" behind the news, not just the "what."
   Frustrations: Finds it difficult to find sources outside of their own bubble and to gauge the credibility of different outlets.

5. Features & Functional Requirements
   Feature 1: AI-Powered Topic Synthesis (Core Feature)
   Description: The system identifies a news event, aggregates articles from a curated list of diverse sources, and generates a single, concise summary.
   User Stories:
   As Alex, I want to see a top-level summary of a major news story on the homepage so I can understand its key points in under 60 seconds.
   As a user, I want the summary to clearly cite the sources used so I can click through to the original articles if I wish.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Summaries must be generated automatically.
   The summary must be presented in a clean, readable format, estimated to be a 2-3 minute read.
   Each synthesized point should ideally be traceable back to its source articles.
   Sources must be listed and hyperlinked below the summary.
   Feature 2: The Perspective Spectrum
   Description: A visual component that maps the sources used in a synthesis onto a political bias spectrum (e.g., Left, Center-Left, Center, Center-Right, Right).
   User Stories:
   As Sam, I want to see a visual chart showing the political leaning of the sources for a story so I can quickly understand how different sides are reporting it.
   As a user, I want to hover over a source on the spectrum to see key phrases or points they uniquely emphasized.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   A visual spectrum is displayed with each synthesized story.
   The methodology for source placement must be accessible and transparent (e.g., based on established ratings like AllSides or Ad Fontes Media).
   The UI must be interactive and intuitive.
   Feature 3: "Just the Facts" Mode
   Description: A toggle that refines the synthesized summary to show only objective, verifiable facts that are corroborated across multiple sources of differing biases.
   User Stories:
   As Alex, I want to be able to switch to a "facts-only" view to quickly get the undisputed core of the story without any spin or opinion.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   A clear UI toggle/button is present on the article page.
   When activated, the summary text is filtered to remove sentences identified by the AI as speculation, opinion, or analysis.
   The change in the text must be visually apparent to the user.
   Feature 4: Customizable Daily Briefing
   Description: Users can create a personal account, select topics of interest, and receive a daily synthesized briefing via email or in-app notification.
   User Stories:
   As Alex, I want to sign up and select "Technology" and "Finance" so I can receive a single morning email summarizing the top stories in those categories.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Simple user registration and profile creation.
   A user-friendly interface for selecting/deselecting topics.
   The briefing must be delivered reliably at a user-specified time.

6. Design & UX Considerations
   UI Philosophy: Clean, minimalist, and text-focused. The design should feel authoritative and trustworthy, like a modern digital newspaper. Avoid clutter, ads (for MVP), and sensationalist imagery.
   Data Visualization: The Perspective Spectrum is a key differentiator and must be designed to be clear, elegant, and easy to understand at a glance.
   Mobile-First: The web app must be fully responsive and provide an excellent experience on mobile devices, as many users consume news on their phones.

7. Technical Considerations
   News Aggregation: Utilize a robust news API (e.g., NewsAPI.org, GDELT, or a custom scraper) to pull articles from a wide and diverse set of sources.
   AI & NLP: Employ a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) API (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT series) for the summarization, fact extraction, and perspective analysis.
   Backend: A scalable backend (e.g., Python with Django/Flask, Node.js) capable of handling cron jobs for aggregation and AI processing.
   Frontend: A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
   Database: A database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user data, topics, sources, and synthesized articles.
