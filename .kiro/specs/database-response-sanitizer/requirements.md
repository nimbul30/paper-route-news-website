# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where Oracle database driver (oracledb) returns complex objects with metadata, internal functions, and self-references instead of clean data. This causes 404 errors with malformed URLs and 500 server crashes due to circular structure errors during JSON serialization. The solution involves implementing a robust data sanitization system that transforms complex database response objects into clean, serializable data structures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web application, I want to receive clean data objects from database queries, so that I can generate proper URLs and avoid malformed links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Oracle database driver returns a complex object with metadata THEN the system SHALL extract only the essential data properties (SLUG, TITLE, etc.)
2. WHEN building URLs from database response data THEN the system SHALL use clean string values without metadata artifacts
3. WHEN the homepage script requests article data THEN the system SHALL return an array of simple objects with only the required properties
4. IF a database response contains self-references or circular structures THEN the system SHALL break these references during sanitization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a server application, I want to serialize database responses to JSON without errors, so that I can send data to client applications without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON.stringify() is called on sanitized database responses THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without circular structure errors
2. WHEN sending article data to the browser THEN the system SHALL ensure the data contains no self-references or internal functions
3. IF the original database response contains circular references THEN the system SHALL create a new clean object with only the necessary properties
4. WHEN processing single article requests THEN the system SHALL return sanitized objects that can be safely serialized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable data sanitization utility, so that I can consistently clean database responses across different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any part of the application receives Oracle database responses THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent sanitization method
2. WHEN sanitizing database objects THEN the system SHALL preserve all essential business data while removing metadata
3. IF new database response formats are encountered THEN the sanitization utility SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking
4. WHEN multiple database queries return complex objects THEN the system SHALL sanitize all responses using the same reliable method

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error handling for data sanitization failures, so that the application remains stable even when unexpected data structures are encountered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sanitization encounters an unexpected data structure THEN the system SHALL log the error and return a safe fallback object
2. IF sanitization fails completely THEN the system SHALL return an empty object or null rather than crashing
3. WHEN processing malformed database responses THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue operation
4. IF circular references cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL break the references and log a warning message
